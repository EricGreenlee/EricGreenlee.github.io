I am interested in pursuing a PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering or related field that focuses on improving wireless data transfer and communication for conservation, climate change, and social equity applications. My education at Dartmouth College (Bachelor’s of Engineering in Electrical Engineering) and at the University of Maryland (Master’s of Engineering in Electrical and Computer Engineering) have equipped me with engineering, problem solving, and interpersonal skills to address these challenges both technologically and socially. Through my experience as a RF engineer at the Department of Defense for the past three years, I’ve developed extensive technical expertise and demonstrated leadership, interpersonal, and analytical skills, which have been recognized through multiple special achievement awards. Outside of my full-time job at the Department of Defense, I’ve designed and implemented a Wireless Sensor Network for ecologists to aggregate data in remote field sites, specifically, in Madagascar. The organization I founded, MESH Sensors, has allowed me to develop my technical and leadership skills and direct my expertise and energy toward conservation and climate change mitigation.

I am primarily interested in programs that will enable me to work directly with communities who would benefit from wireless technology, working on the ground with stakeholders to iteratively design useful, targeted solutions specific to each application. I am currently working with ecologists in Madagascar, conservationists in Cambodia, Indigenous rights groups in Ecuador, and land managers in Oregon. I am looking for labs that provide guidance and mentorship in the areas of technology, project management, and partner engagement to enable me to design long-term, quality solutions for these groups and to introduce me to new areas and partners who would benefit from applications of similar technology. I value programs that will empower me to publish my research frequently so that others can benefit from my work and to build strong partnerships with other researchers working on similar problems. I also hope to take courses and collaborate in related fields such as ecology, earth science, anthropology, and philosophy of science and technology.

I am excited to start a PhD program in the fall of 2022 at the intersection of electrical and RF engineering and the natural environment.  I intend to equip myself with the skills and partnerships needed to increase the positive impact of technology in the areas of conservation, climate change, and social equity.
