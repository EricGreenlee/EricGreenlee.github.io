Digital Embedded Projects
=====
* Built an 8-key digital keyboard in VHDL for an Artix-7 FPGA. Features include playing multiple notes at once, volume normalization, and a blues modes with a pentatonic scale. *Dartmouth ENGS31*

* Built a digitally tunable FM radio in VHDL for a Zybo Z7 FPGA. Wrote custom mixer, CIC and FIR filters, and demodulator. *Dartmouth ENGS128*

* Designed, at the transistor level with the CMOS family, a 4-bit shifter for logical, arithmetic, and cyclic shifts. Simulated the design in Cadence and optimized performance. *UMD ENPM610*
